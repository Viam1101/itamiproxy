# Growtopia Multi-Threaded ENet Proxy
- This proxy was created from scratch, and all threads are synchronized; feel free to fork and develop it.
- Atomic bools and Mutex were used to ensure synchronization.
- There is currently no feature other than joining the game. Extremely pure.
- I also fixed the timeout issue that occurs in the majority of the proxies and is a pain in the rear.

# NOTE:
- People who use this source to steal save.dat are retarded maggots.
- Same applies for those who market an open source software.
